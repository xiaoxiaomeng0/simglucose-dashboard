# simglucose-dashboard

This web app for the Type-1 Diabetes simulation engine [simglucose](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose). This app should have the following features:
- It is able to configure the simulation settings to run different simulation experiments.
- Visualize the simulation in real time (time-series plot).
- It saves the simulation data into a well-structured database for queries later, e.g. query by patient names, by time range etc.
- It performs statistical analysis for the saved simulation data. Analyze the distribution of the results and visualize them easily in appropriate charts (histogram, scatter plots, time-series plots etc.)
